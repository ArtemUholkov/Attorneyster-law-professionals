      var swiper = new Swiper('.mySwiper', {
        navigation: {
          nextEl: '.swiper-button-next',
          prevEl: '.swiper-button-prev',
        },
        loop: true,
        autoplay: {
          delay: 3000,
        },
      });
    </script>
```

4. Responsive form created with RegExp to make sure inputs filled correctly.
